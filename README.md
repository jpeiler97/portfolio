# Portfolio CSS Homework

## Assignment
For this assignment I was asked to create a responsive web page from scratch, using what I have learned so far in my coding bootcamp. 

At minimum I needed to include a bio, projects and contact links, but I wanted to make sure my web page had a consistent theme and good flow. I kept my header fixed so the user can navigate on the page without having to scroll. My background was originally going to be a stock design of a mountain sunset, but I found that distracting against the content so I used a gradient inspired by the colors. I like the look of rounded edges on web apps so I gave most containers a border-radius. I gave the links in the contact section colors and icons to match their respective website, so users can recognize them without text labels. I relied on CSS Flexbox for most of my content because it was the easiest way to keep my page responsive.
